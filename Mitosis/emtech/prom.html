                Significant figures refer to the digits in a number that contribute to its precision. They include all the certain digits and the first uncertain or estimated digit. For example, in the number 123.45, all five digits are significant because they represent meaningful information about the precision of the value. Significant figures are crucial in scientific and engineering calculations, as they help communicate the accuracy of measurements.
                <br><br>
                The rules for determining significant figures are straightforward: all non-zero digits are significant, while zeroes can be significant or not, depending on their position. Leading zeros (zeros before any non-zero digit) are not significant. For example, in 0.0045, only the '4' and '5' are significant. In contrast, trailing zeros (zeros after a non-zero digit) are significant if there is a decimal point present, as in 45.00, where all four digits are significant. However, without a decimal point, trailing zeros are not considered significant, such as in 4500, which has only two significant figures.
                <br><br>
                Significant figures are essential when performing calculations, as they prevent the introduction of false precision. In addition, rules govern how many significant figures should be retained when performing mathematical operations. For multiplication and division, the result should be rounded to the same number of significant figures as the factor with the fewest significant figures. For addition and subtraction, the result should be rounded to the least number of decimal places present in the original values.
                <br><br>
                When multiplying or dividing, your answer should match the fewest significant figures in the inputs. For addition or subtraction, round to the least precise decimal place.
